Order of game code running

  The order in which these events per object run is based on memory which one was added to the room first
	or something to the effect. It is not something that is controlable. This is most relevent when a player
	must interact with an object, its important the objects code has run before the players, so that timing of
	it matches. Example being a moving platform needs to have moved (run its code) in the the event prior to 
	the players interaction with it, so it can run in the begin step, while the player runs in the step. Could also
	happen in the end step, point is that the player runs at a differnt time then the thing it needs to interact with
	so that all parameters can be calculated correctly.
